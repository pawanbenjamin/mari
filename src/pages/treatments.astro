        Visceral Manipulation uses an in depth understanding of the anatomy in
        order to address fascial restrictions around the organ systems. Visceral

      <h2>Pelvic Floor Physical Therapy</h2>

      <p>
        Pelvic floor physical therapy address the whole body with a deeper
        understanding of the pelvic floor muscles, nerves, organs, and function.
        As a pelvic floor physical therapist my goal is to empower each person
        to understand how their pelvic floor functions and to support them
        reaching their goals. The pelvic floor is a truly special area of the
        body because it is the only area in the body where our skeletal muscle
        have a direct impact on our organs (bowel, bladder, uterus, prostate).
        Therefor dysfunction at the pelvic floor can lead to bowel/bladder
        incontinence, retention, constipation, sexual dysfunction, pain, and
        more. Also, because the pelvic floor is one of our core muscles in can
        often be a missing link in persistent back pain, sciatica, and hip pain.

      <h2>Myofascial Release</h2>
      <p>
        Myofascial release techniques address restrictions in the body's
        connective tissue matrix. Connective tissue, or fascia, is a network of
        tissue that connects our muscles, organs, and bones. Thickening of the
        fascia restricts motion in tissue which can lead to pain and
        dysfunction. Myofascial release uses a variety of tissue manipulation
        techniques to promote mobility in the fascia to decrease pain and
        improve movement.
