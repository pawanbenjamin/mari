        My whole life, I have known that my path is to support others thrive in
        their journey toward healing and wholeness. My interest in manual
        therapy started when I was eight and my dad herniated a disc in his
        back, developing sciatica that after a while made it really difficult
        for him to move. For weeks he was mainly bedridden. I would bring him
        hot packs in bed and try to lift his spirits. When my dad seemed at a
        loss for what to do, my mom, a physical therapist, asked one of her
        manual physical therapist buddies to help out. She would come to the
        house, throw a mat on the floor, and treat my dad. I would watch in
        fascination as my dad was able to move better and better after every
        session. He was diligent with his exercises and now, over 30 years later
        he is active, strong, and never needed surgery! This was the start of my
        curiosity, deep awe, and respect for the body's innate ability to heal.

        As a college student I studied physical therapy at the University of
        Connecticut graduating in 2004. At school I was passionate about
        advocating for women’s health and women’s right to choose and be
        informed about all aspects of their health. Also, as one of the only
        Latina’s and POC folks in the physical therapy and allied health
        department, I was acutely aware of the disparities in health research
        and access to healthcare among BIPOC communities. I completed my
        graduation thesis on Psychosocial Barriers to Physical Activity in
        Puerto Rican Women and published my research in the Journal of Strength
        and Conditioning. I also gave lectures at local conferences on the
        importance of healthcare practitioners recognizing the racial and ethic
        differences when developing treatment plans.

        Knowing that I wanted to focus my career in pelvic health, I completed
        the course work through the Herman & Wallace Pelvic Rehabilitation
        Institute and began a fulfilling career as a pelvic health physical
        therapist. I have worked at the National Rehabilitation Institute, Kirk
        Center for Health Living in the Chicagoland region, a specialty clinic
        for pelvic floor dysfunction, and in 2012 I was the co-founder and
        co-owner of Body Connect Health and Wellness in Washington DC. At Body
        Connect one of our main missions was not only to provide exceptional
        care for all persons with pelvic floor dysfunction but also to empower
        the community through education classes on topics ranging from work
        ergonomics, pre and postpartum wellness, to sexual health throughout the
        lifespan.
