At Mariposa wellness our goals for treatment during pregnancy and postpartum are to improve fetal and parent alignment to allow for greater ease with labor and delivery, and help accelerate the new parent’s recovery after childbirth."

    title="male pelvic health"
    desc="Our specialized Pelvic Floor Physical Therapists also treat conditions that are specific to the health of male urological and sexual function. For men, fascial restrictions in the pelvic floor and pelvic girdle can cause sexual dysfunction, difficulty with urination and bowel movements, or pelvic pain. Fascial restrictions in the male pelvis are often caused by poor postural alignment or scarring from abdominal or pelvic surgeries. Our Pelvic Floor Physical Therapists will help to reduce adhered scar tissue restrictions, and will also help to improve flexibility and normalize function to the urinary and reproductive systems."

    desc="Chronic pain, like neck or back pain, can be caused by poor posture, accidents, falls, emotional trauma, surgeries and disease. It can significantly impact a person’s life and function and can be crippling to the mind, body and spirit. This is why it is extremely important to address these conditions holistically. At Mariposa Wellness we use integrative manual therapy techniques including Core Synchronism, Visceral Manipulation, and Myofascial Release to effectively treat persistent pain, release blocked emotional tension and improve postural and functionality in the body."
